project Name: school fees registory system,
    this project is to bring technology into the Nigeria Primary and secondary education system
    the project uses basic technologies as HTML5 CSS3 and javascript to write the programme of which it operates

    the UI was inspired by a UI i saw at behance.com and replicated though with a little change.
    
    this project helped me to master the CRUD operation using javacript 
    the CRUD stands for CREATE READ UPDATE AND DELETE 
    it enables a user select a class and input the name of the student 
    and then dynamically update the amount paid in the ui and the student is been displayed on the 
    table each student is been stored in the web local storage 
    
    other features will be added as soon as possble.
